Input:
- dt : delta t (dt= 0.0001 by default)
- c : constant (c=1 by default)
- set.seed : 'logical parameter (set.seed=TRUE by default, if 
set.seed=FALSE the random numbers do change with repeated execution of the function)'

Output:  A plot of the simulated process and a plot of the corresponding Ito Integral
